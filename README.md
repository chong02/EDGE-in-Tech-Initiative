# EDGE in Tech Initiative at UC
I worked with Director Jill Finlayson and the EDGE in Tech Initiative at UC devoted to promoting equity within tech. For this particular project, my team and I were tasked with analyzing UC Berkeley's College oF Engineering graduate programs to identify gaps in equity. More specifically, I focused on investigating gaps in academic performance between graduate students who received their undergraduate degrees from UC schools; CSU schools; and those who came from in-state private schools, out-of-state public schools, out-of-state private schools, and international schools. Granular data has been excluded from this repository. This project was completed using the Python library developed at UC Berkeley for their introductory Data Science coures Data C8.
